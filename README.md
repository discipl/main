Discipl

The current way society is organised and facilitated presorts it’s ongoing development towards a future which when we realise we have a choice might not be the best fit for what we actually want. We increasingly keep each other busy with tasks and a siloed focus on topics that really do not address how to attend to our actual needs.  Discipl attempts to articulate an architecture for any society that embraces technology in a sustainable way so it can be applied for any type of current and future society, not excluding the ones that for most people now seem impossible. It addresses the lack of a coherent vision of how a society as a whole, from local to global and apart from the values people in it decide to hold on together, can be facilitated optimally through looking at society in a systemic way.

Discipl does not include concepts that do not have to have a place in every of the possible types of society that embrace technology in a sustainable way. What you automatically end up with is a simple core architecture for a society that just attends to any need of any person in it as a main organizing principle. It turns out that a society that does just that through non violent collaboration might even be realisable once we could manage to liberate ourselves of a persistent and self replicating pattern of increasing disconnection from each other, which over a long time now even has gotten deeply ingrained in languages and cultures almost everywhere in the world.

Discipl integrates all needs and as such it also integrates all of currently existing societies willing to embrace technology for good in a sustainable way with all the agreements (laws) that are already there. The scope and focus of Discipl however lowers the threshold and adds the ability to shift into different tracks towards any (preferable) alternative that now may seem naive and utopian, because systems in society got us in a deep track that however seems to steer us unconsciously (Actor Network Theory) towards a future that might be one not of our choosing. At least, in this way, Discipl is better prepared to adopt a wider range of future changes we choose to make to society for solving wicked problems while the world around us is changing fast. We also hope Discipl will result in people to get more aware of their own needs and that of others and will stimulate engaging with our differences, restoring the connection between all people such that they can collaboratively make the choices solving all the wicked problems we now keep struggling with and as such steers us towards a society that works for all.

Discipl identifies an easy to remember set of main principles out of which the architecture unfolds. These principles are:

- Attend to all needs
- Non violent collaboration
- Open free knowledge
- Anonymous transparency
- Sustainable Nature 2.0

Discipl secures its coherent set of principles with a distributed collaborative information platform (which is where Discipl stands for), a software stack of free open source reusable components in which all information is stored as verifiable linked data claims on any kind of data storage platform that could hold them in a hybrid way. This includes verifiable claim wallets, distributed ledgers as well as any other current legacy system. On top of this there are several components that facilitates people to attend to needs following what we call the Discipl Pattern:

- People with needs ...
- create or deliver abundance services that attend to needs …
- that attend to and match needs as they see fit, guided by known guidelines to attend to all relating needs as best as possible …
- and that attend to any unmet or conflicting need people still might have …
- through engaging with conflicts by mediating them to solutions that attend to all needs of everyone involved ...
- and publish these principles as principle based law, policy and or contracts to be interpreted as guidelines for attending to all needs.

When organizing society around the main principle of attending to all needs following the Discipl pattern, people will just publish their needs out in the open in a anonymous way. Abundance services created out of a need to attend to needs will discover and match themselves with any unmet needs and will just attend to them in a more private peer to peer connection with the entity that published its need. Abundance services will be able to use a Discipl software component to interpret known guidelines as how to best attend to a need while also taking into account the needs of others and how to explain all this to the person in need that is involved.

Not all needs will or can be met easily without collaborating with others. There might even be conflicts. Using Discipl software components that support in an efficient non violent collaborative decision and conflict engagement process, currently based on the Advice Proces (Laloux) and Convergent Facilitation for more complex situations, a restorative justice and legal system will be made possible instead of a retributive one such that engaging with conflicts results in real solutions that really do justice to the society as a whole and for instance do not induce shame in people with its high risk of resulting in violence at a later time. Some conflicts can be handled locally, others must be handled at more global levels. Discipl components will also facilitate in escalation processes when needed such that this is taken into account and the right people can get included.

People will not always be aware of their needs, or know about all the needs that could easily be attended to. For most people we envision they could get help by utilizing a local AI Advisor on their own device that would have access to their private information and would advise them, given known guidelines, what needs would be easily attended to and how given their situation and would help them express them and have them attended to. We envision to provide in such a AI advisor in 2020 as a reference implementation and gave it the name “Blue Fairy”.

We realize this does not take into account the needs of still quite a large group of people that are tech-savvy, disabled or unwilling for which a non imposing care system with appropriate (mostly human) abundance services must be in place to connect with these group of people and offer them help proactively without imposing or shaming them.

Then there is the garbage problem. We could already do away with a lot of tasks surrounding to keep track of who is getting what value in the illusion this value would get distributed evenly if people's needs, capabilities and efforts were even. But you might ask who is going to do the mundane tasks that people still need to get done? We hope instead on focussing everything that has to do with giving and receiving equally, more effort will be put by people that like to automate stuff to increase production and distribution to the level of just enough for whatever people ask for doing so. This should result in free open source autonomous systems that can easily be replicated and deployed. A vision that for instance also has been picked up in the Nature 2.0 track of the Odyssee hackathon (http://nature2.ooo) that was introduced after the hackathon in 2017 in which a first concept Discipl was first shown. Emerging technologies make this kind of solutions possible now more than ever and are already being built. We realize this all must be done in a sustainable way however in which technology does no harm nature including us and blends in just enough.

In the meanwhile Discipl can perfectly applied in the current world as is no matter what happens and is innovating with emerging technologies to be shared freely with anyone. We might however not be able to solve many current wicked problems without creating more problems if we keep competing and do not start to collaborate. We envision that to enable this, Open Free Knowlegde will be the new standard to work with just like we all want to say we are taking care of climate change. You can still own material things and keep information private, but you are stimulated to share information and can not claim it as your property when this information pops up elsewhere unless it is personal information.

We need information to be unbiased by competition if we take actions based on that information. Also we then could let go of a need to know everyone's personal information instead of a competition to avoid leaking them, and that we can really trust to share as much as anonymous statistics to get everyone informed as best as possible. Services for material needs will be anonymous yet fully transparent by design. Services for non material needs will start anonymous but involve establishing a trusted empathic connection between people. Discipl components will help securing this in a world in transition.

The Discipl Infographic (structured as a NORA 5 layer architecture) above summarizes all this.

We are currently working on a comparison of how all of this relates to the dutch constitution, NORA, UN SDG’s, NGL Community and more
